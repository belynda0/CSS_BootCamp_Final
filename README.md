**Main Question:**
Do blue states have stricter crime policies than red states?

To explore this, we are examining gubernatorial races where election results have flipped and assessing their impact on prison populations over a five-year period. Is there a noticeable difference in population trends between Democratic and Republican states?

Background:
The comparison of crime policies between blue states (typically Democratic) and red states (typically Republican) is complex and nuanced. Generally, blue states tend to implement more progressive policies, such as focusing on rehabilitation, reducing incarceration rates, and enforcing stricter gun control laws. Red states, on the other hand, often emphasize tougher sentencing, increased police funding, and more lenient gun laws.

However, the effectiveness and impact of these policies can vary widely. Some studies suggest that red states may have higher overall violent crime rates, while blue states may have higher crime rates in urban areas. It's important to note that differences in crime rates can often be attributed to social, economic, and demographic factors rather than the policies themselves.

Study Limitations:
This study has several limitations that must be acknowledged:

Prisoner Mortality: The analysis did not account for prisoners who died during the study period.
Transfers: It overlooked prisoners transferred to facilities in other states.
Parole: Individuals on parole were not included in the evaluation.
Legislative Impact: The study did not fully address the time required for new laws to influence case outcomes or fully assess the impact of legislative changes.
These limitations suggest that the findings may not fully capture the complexities of the prison system and the broader legal processes.
